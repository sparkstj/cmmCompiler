# Compiler-Labs

This is a collection of compiler course labs, all together it would leads to a compiler of simplified version of C language, here we call it cmm. All labs are implemented using C and other tools that helps build compilers, such as flex and bison for lexical analysis.

This can be run in mac os environment with flex and bison installed. To compile, enter `make`.

The executive file parser can be used as `./parser [*.cmm] [*.s]` to get a MIPS32 code file `*.s`.
